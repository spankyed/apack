 * macOS backend releases its event stream from two threads when a watched directory is deleted as its watch

 * either of which corrupts the heap of the process that holds the user's database, and its Linux one refuses to
 * close a watch whose directory was deleted moments before and leaves inotify watches with the process. Before
 * moving a platform onto a library, close a watch as its directory is deleted, a few hundred times over, and
