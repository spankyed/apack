// Live reads: `watch` runs a read with every database read it makes tracked under a token of its own, which elmdb files
// in its interval index (`elmdb/docs/architecture/engine.md`, Change sets and watch), and runs it again after each
// commit that names the token, handing the listener the result when it changed. A result equal to the last delivered is
// not delivered. A read that consults anything but the database isn't tracked, and goes stale when that changes: a
// watched read is a pure read of the engine.
//
// How often a watch runs again is this scheduler's, whatever writes, and no view or writer opts in (G14 of elmdb's
// goal-elmdb-next.md). Re-runs wait until the writing code has returned (a microtask), so a burst of commits in one
// turn costs one. A watch has at most one run pending: commits arriving meanwhile only mark it dirty, so the run that
// follows reads the latest state and the states between are skipped. A watch that ran recently waits a gap
// proportional to what that run cost, and at least a frame, before it runs again; one idle when a commit lands runs at
// once. A flush spends at most a slice of time on runs, and the watches left over run first in the next one; a watch
// whose last run would overrun what is left waits for that, so an expensive watch never holds a cheap one back.
